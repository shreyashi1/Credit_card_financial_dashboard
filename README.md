# Credit_card_financial_dashboard
This project focuses on developing an interactive and informative weekly dashboard that provides real-time insights into crucial credit card performance metrics and trends. By visualizing key data points, this dashboard will empower stakeholders with the ability to effectively monitor and analyze credit card operations, identify areas for improvement, and make data-driven decisions to optimize business performance.
# Project Objectives
This project aims to analyze weekly credit card transaction data in conjunction with customer information to:
### Track Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): </br>
Measure and analyze critical metrics such as revenue generated, transaction volume, interest earned, delinquency rates, customer acquisition costs, and customer satisfaction scores.
Leverage these insights to evaluate overall credit card performance, identify areas for improvement, and make data-driven decisions to boost growth and profitability.
### Deep Dive into Revenue Trends: </br>
Conduct in-depth analysis of revenue generated from credit card transactions across different timeframes: quarters, weeks, and months.
Uncover revenue trends, seasonal patterns, and fluctuations in customer spending habits over time.
### Understand Customer Spending Behavior: </br>
Explore and analyze customer spending habits and preferences across various card categories (e.g., Gold, Platinum) and expenditure types (e.g., Bills, Entertainment, Travel).
Gain valuable insights into customer demographics, purchasing preferences, and overall spending patterns.
### Customer Segmentation Analysis: </br>
Analyze revenue performance based on key customer demographics such as educational level, job type, and income group.
Identify customer segments with high spending potential and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.
### Week-on-Week Revenue Tracking:
Perform detailed week-on-week revenue comparisons to identify trends, anomalies, and deviations from expected revenue patterns.
Leverage this analysis to proactively respond to market dynamics, capitalize on revenue opportunities, and mitigate potential risks.
These objectives provide a clear and concise roadmap for the credit card analysis project, focusing on actionable insights that will drive business improvement.
# Software Used
- MySQL
- PowerBI
# Methodology
This project commenced with the establishment of a robust data foundation by creating dedicated tables within a MySQL database to store transaction and customer data. Raw data was then seamlessly imported from CSV files into these tables. A direct connection was established between the MySQL database and Power BI, enabling real-time data access and facilitating dynamic data visualization and analysis. Subsequently, rigorous data cleaning and transformation processes were undertaken, including handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and creating new calculated columns using DAX queries. Finally, key performance indicators (KPIs) relevant to the credit card business were defined and developed to provide a quantitative measure of business performance and enable effective monitoring and tracking of critical success factors.
